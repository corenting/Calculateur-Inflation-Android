This converter allows you to calculate the buying power in a specified year of any amount of money (for USA, UK and France) to an equivalent amount in another year by taking into account the inflation rate between these two years.<br />

To achieve this, this app uses data from various sources :
- The Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) for the USA
- The Office for National Statistics (https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/cdko/mm23) for the UK
- The INSEE (https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/serie/001643154) for France
